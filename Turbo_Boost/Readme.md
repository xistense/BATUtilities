#Enable/Disable Turbo Boost via cmd.

This was created as a measure to lower temperatures on some Intel CPUs, as Turbo Boost might push them to high values(especially in laptops). Note that you will not benefit from Turbo Boost performance if you disable it, but you might not notice if you do not use compute intensive applications(eg. gaming, rendering, etc). 

Works with Windows 10/Windows 11.
